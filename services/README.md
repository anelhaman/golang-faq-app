# Golang QA App

`golang-qa-app` is a question-answering API built in Go. It reads questions and answers from multiple CSV or Excel files and responds with the answer that most closely matches a given query. The application includes confidence scoring and timestamps in responses.

## Features

- Reads from multiple CSV or Excel files, specified in a YAML configuration file.
- Compares the input query with stored questions and returns the best-matched answer along with a confidence score.
- Returns responses as a JSON API via Gin Gonic.
- Supports Go Modules and is designed using an interface-based architecture with separate files for scalability and readability.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Go 1.18+
- Gin Gonic
- Excelize (for handling Excel files)
- YAML v3
Install dependencies:

```
go mod tidy
```
## Configuration
Create a config/config.yaml file to specify the paths of your CSV or Excel files:

```
files:
  - path: "data/questions1.csv"
    type: "csv"
  - path: "data/questions2.xlsx"
    type: "excel"
```

## Running the Application
To start the application:

```
go run main.go
```
The API will run on http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints

Example:

```
GET http://localhost:8080/answer?query=What is Golang?
```

Response:


```
{
  "answer": "Golang is an open-source programming language.",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "timestamp": "2024-11-11T15:04:05Z"
}
```

## Code Overview
- interfaces/qa_source.go: Defines the QuestionAnswerSource interface, which includes methods to load and retrieve questions and answers.
- handlers/: Contains CSVHandler and ExcelHandler, which implement QuestionAnswerSource.
- services/qa_service.go: The core service that processes the query, calculates similarity, and provides the answer with confidence.
- main.go: Initializes the application, loads data sources, and starts the Gin server.
